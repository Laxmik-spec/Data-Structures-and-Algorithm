** Stack
1. Linear Data Structure.
2. It follows Last In First Out (LIFO) order.
3. Insertion and deletion is done from one end.
4. Push is used to insert elements into the stack.
5. Pop is used to remove elemets from the stack.

** Stack Functions
1. push(x): It is used to insert elements to the stack
2. pop(x): It is used to remove elements from the stack
3. size(): gives the size of the stack
4. top(): give refrence of the last element in the stack
5. empty(): returns true for an empty stack
for every function time complexity is O(1)

** Stack Implementation
1. Using list
2. Using deque
3. Using queue

** Advantages
1. Maintains data in LIFO Order
2. Last element is readily avaliable to use
3. All operations are of O(1) complexity

** Disdavantages
1. Manipulation is restricted to the top of the stack
2. Not much flexible
