** Array 
1. It is a linear data structure
2. Contigious Memory location
3. Access elements randomly
4. Homogeneous Elements (ie similar elemets)

** 1-Dimensional Array
1. 1D can be related to a row
2. Elements are stored one after the another
3. Only 1 subscript or index is used

** 2-Dimensional Array
1. 2D can be related to a table or matrix
2. Elements are stored one after the another ie one 1D array inside another
3. Two subscripts or indices are used, one row and one column
4. Dimensions depend upon the number of subscripts used

** Array Implementation
1. Create 1D array and insert elements into the array and access the elements of the array
2. Create 2D array and insert elements into the array and access the elements of the array
3. Search, Sort, Delete operations on array of integrers

** Advantages 
1. Random access elements
2. Easy sorting and iteration
3. Replacement of multiple variables

** Disadvantages 
1. Size is fixed
2. Difficult to insert and delete
3. If capacity is more and occupacy less, most of the array gets wasted
4. Needs contigious memory
