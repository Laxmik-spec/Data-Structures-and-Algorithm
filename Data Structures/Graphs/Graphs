** Graph
1. Graph is a data structure derived concept of mathematics
2. Graph is a collection of vertices and edges represents relationship between the vertices


** Representation of Graph

        A
      /   \         A,B,C,D are the vertices
      B    D        AB, AD, BC, DC are the edges
      \   /
        C


** Breadth First Search
It is an algorithm to trace the nodes of the graph in a breadth-first-search order, that is the neighbouring nodes  in a single level are traversed first, then the nodes in the next level are traversed.

                  40   50 60   70   Level2 / Level1


** Depth First Search
It is an algorithm to trace the nodes of the graph in a depth first order, the nodes in one depth are traversed first, then the nodes in the parallel depth are traversed. It uses the concept of back-tracking after one vertical depth is traversed
