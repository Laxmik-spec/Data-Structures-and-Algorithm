** Linear Search
1. It helps you to search for the element in a linear fashion
2. It checks for each element for the element to be searched
3. Since it is done in linear fashion, it is termed as linear search


** Linear Search Algorithm

linearSearch(arr, item)
    for each element in array
        if element == item
            return its index
    return -1


** Time Complexity
1. Best Case - 0(1)
2. Average Case - 0(n)
3. Worst Case - 0(n)
4. Here all the elements needs to be compared in worst case to search the given element
5. Best case is when the first element gets matched with the first element to be searched


** Space Complexity
1. No auxiliary space is required in Linear Search Implementation
2. Hence space complexity is 0(1)
