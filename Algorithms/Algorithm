** Algorithm
1. It is a step by step approach to slove a particular Algorithm
2. It gives a crisp solution
3. Its free of programming language constraints
4. There can be multiple possible algorithms to solve the given problem


** Algorithm Analysis
1. It helps in the indentification of optimal algorithm
2. It helps in understanding the trade-off of time and space requirement


** Algorithm Analysis Types
1. There are different types of algorithm analysis
    a. Best Case
    b. Average Case
    c. Worst Case
2. Worst Case is computed always for the analysis as it dictates maximum resource requirements
