** Queue
1. Linear Data Structure
2. Follows: First In First Out (FIFO)
3. Insertion can take place from the rear end
4. Deletion can take place from the front end
5. Ex: Ticket booking
6. 4 major operations:
    enqueue(ele) - used to insert element at top
    dequeue() - remove the top element from the queue
    peekfirst() - to get the first element from the queue
    peeklast() - to get the last element from the queue
7. All operations work in constant time O(1)

** Applications
1. Scheduling
2. Maintaining playlist
3. Interrupt handling

** Advantages
1. Maintains data in FIPO
2. Insertion from beginning and deletion end takes O(1) time

** Disadvantages
1. Manipulation is restricted from front and rear
2. Not much flexible
